Matlab programs of the paper "Estimating the maximum Lyapunov exponent with denoised data to test for chaos in the German stock market".

This collection of Matlab programs allow to conduct the Monte Carlo experiments and the empirical analysis of the paper "Estimating the maximum Lyapunov exponent with denoised data to test for chaos in the German stock market" submitted to Computational Economics (2024). All they run under Matlab R2022b.

The programs are slightly variations of the original one written by BenSa√Øda (2014).
